# Python API Challenge

This project explores weather patterns across over 500 cities worldwide, analyzing the impact of proximity to the equator on climate variables. Using the OpenWeatherMap API and citipy library. 

Part 1: WeatherPy focuses on visualizing relationships between latitude and weather phenomena such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, supplemented with linear regression analysis for deeper insights.

Part 2: VacationPy takes a creative turn, using weather data to identify ideal vacation spots. With the help of the Geoapify API and geoViews library, it generates maps highlighting cities that match preferred weather conditions and locates nearby hotels for convenience.

Reworked the vacationPy to fix bugs with help from my T.A. Dwight Thieme
